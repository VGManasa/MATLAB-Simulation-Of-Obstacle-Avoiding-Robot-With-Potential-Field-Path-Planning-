# MATLAB-Simulation-Of-Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot-With-Potential-Field-Path-Planning-
This project simulates an autonomous robot navigating a 2D environment using the Potential Field Path Planning method in MATLAB. The robot is guided by attractive forces toward the target and repulsive forces away from obstacles, enabling it to plan a smooth, collision-free path in real-time.
